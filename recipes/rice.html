<h3>Very easy rice recipe</h3>

    <li> Salt</li>
    <li> Garlic (optional)</li>
</ul>
<h4> Steps!</h4>
<ol> 
    <li> Start by boiling enough water to cook the rice. It's usually a 2 for 1 measure. So if you want to cook one cup of rice you need 2 cups of water</li>
    <li> If you want to, you can add some cloves for garlic into the boiling water along with the salt (you usually want 1 teaspoon of salt for every cup of rice</li>
    <li> Add the rice and leave it to cook</li>
    <li> If you see that the water is not enough to soften the rice you can add some more. Different kinds of rice may need a little bit more water</li>
